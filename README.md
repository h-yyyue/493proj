# Welcome to *My Atlas*!

To fully enjoy *My Atlas*,  it is recommended to create a simple server to host it. One way to do this is to run the following command in the directory where all of the necessary files are located:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/index1.html in your browser.

This will start a basic web server, allowing you to access *My Atlas* through a web browser and take advantage of all its features.
