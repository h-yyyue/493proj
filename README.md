awwwwwwwww
## Feedbacks in HE:

How will the user be able to leave the more detailed review?

Where will the info from the resources/rate my professor/recommendation come from? Ex: relevant UM courses, will this be complied from user input or outside data? 

Same question for resources under resources section, course videos…

Maybe in the tell us about you feature when leaving a review for a specific class, you can format it a bit like the detailed description view (with buttons instead) so the user can chose to leave just a rating, or just a resource

Will you be keeping track of individual users and allowing them to “save” and keep track of their reviews and info or will you just be added their inputs into a large database? (Will you have users login?)

I like the favorite course page, how will this be considered? By highest rating? Maybe you can have an option to see courses and filter and sort by different factors

Ex: view all math courses, rated 4 stars or higher, and sort by highest to lowest rating

Usability Heuristic 3: User Control & Freedom-

Can the user navigate from page to page? Maybe include a navigation bar, buttons to cancel making a review, etc

Is just having a :) and :( rating enough info to go off by? Sometimes I like and class for some reasons and dont like it for others and its tough to just chose :) or :( for it

I like the design!

- As for the main page, the users may click the “Look for recommendations” button before inputting their course experience. If they click the “Look for recommendations” button first, the web system can’t provide reasonable recommendations with a lack of their course experience information. This will lead to kind of errors. 
- As for the course selection page, the smiley faces and weeping faces may lead to confusion. The users may choose smiley faces due to their interest in this course instead of their academic performances. The meaning of smiley faces and weeping face icons are vague.  Although we designed smiley faces as a kind of indication that the student did excellently in this course, the users may click it just because they enjoy this course. 
- As for the course selection page, we had better let users choose the courses they have taken in a drop-down menu of the search box or a complete list of all the courses. 
-  As for the course recommendation page, the users have no access to information about which departments these courses are from. Lacking such information, the users have to recall or search for the information about the departments of these courses on their own. 
- As for the course information page, the text, buttons, and links are all of the same sizes. This makes it hard for users to find the features they would like to focus on. 
- As for the course information page, the meaning of "more" buttons are vague. They may link to more detailed information or more choices of resources.

on the first index, the title colors should be the same to look better. Choose between blue or black.  Can make the content bigger or fill the page up a bit, cause it looks empty. Sometimes it throws people off from using it.  

Second index looks great, very well put together. Only question is why is only EECS 281 highlighted?

Third index also looks great! No need to change anything, but a recommendation could be to change the format of the layout and how it looks like and fill the page rather than have empty spots on the side. 

Nothing to change on index4.

Last note, maybe change the font of the My Atlas, it may be hard for some to read. It is always better for it to look clear. There are some fonts that are unique but still clear.
