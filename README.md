awwwwwwwww

How will the user be able to leave the more detailed review?
Where will the info from the resources/rate my professor/recommendation come from? Ex: relevant UM courses, will this be complied from user input or outside data? 
Same question for resources under resources section, course videos…
Maybe in the tell us about you feature when leaving a review for a specific class, you can format it a bit like the detailed description view (with buttons instead) so the user can chose to leave just a rating, or just a resource
Will you be keeping track of individual users and allowing them to “save” and keep track of their reviews and info or will you just be added their inputs into a large database? (Will you have users login?)
I like the favorite course page, how will this be considered? By highest rating? Maybe you can have an option to see courses and filter and sort by different factors
Ex: view all math courses, rated 4 stars or higher, and sort by highest to lowest rating
Usability Heuristic 3: User Control & Freedom-
Can the user navigate from page to page? Maybe include a navigation bar, buttons to cancel making a review, etc
Is just having a :) and :( rating enough info to go off by? Sometimes I like and class for some reasons and dont like it for others and its tough to just chose :) or :( for it
I like the design!
